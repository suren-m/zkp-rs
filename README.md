For convenience, below limits are set on key values of the algorithm used during computation.

> These limits help avoiding `u128` arithmetic overflows during `a.pow(b)` and prevent getting negative values when calculating `s = k - c.x` (answer). In real-world implementation, these ranges will be much higher and specialized data structures will be implemented to handle very large numbers.

```rust
pub const MAX_USERNAME_LEN: usize = 50;

// min seed value (random k) set such that "s = k - c.x" is always positive.
pub const MIN_SEED_VAL: u32 = 100;

// max random 'k' value.
// Max value set so that r1 = g^K and r2 = h^K operations don't cause overflows
pub const MAX_SEED_VAL: u32 = 125;

// Max value set so that y1 = g^x and y2 = h^x operations don't cause overflows
pub const MAX_SECRET_VAL: u32 = 25;

// Used when client is making the register commit
// smaller value for convenience when computing y1 = g^x and y2 = h^x as well as r1 = g^k, r2 = h^k
// where k is a random seed generated by client and x is the secret
pub const G: u128 = 1;
pub const H: u128 = 2;

// to avoid negative values during "s = k - c.x" calculation
pub const MAX_CHALLENGE_VAL: u32 = 4;
```
